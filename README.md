# Quotes App
### Skill Assessment

The challenge will contain a few core features most applications have. That includes connecting to an API, basic MVC, exposing an API, and finally tests.

The API we want you to connect to is [https://dummyjson.com/docs/quotes](https://dummyjson.com/docs/quotes)

### Attention Programmers:

Please read the following instructions carefully before beginning the skill test:

1. **Repository**:
The project must be contained in the same repository adn application, both frontend and backend.

2. **Complete All 11 Tasks**: 
Each task is crucial and must be fully completed. Partial completion will not be considered.

3. **Attention to Detail**:
Pay close attention to the specifications and requirements for each task. Accuracy and adherence to instructions are key.

4. **Quality of Work**: 
We are looking for clean, efficient, and well-documented code. Quality is as important as completion.

5. **Bonus Features**: 
Implementing additional features or enhancements not listed in the tasks will earn you extra points. Creativity and innovation are highly valued.

6. **Time Management**: 
We do not expect all tasks to be completed in one sitting.

7. **Submission**: 
Once you have completed all tasks, submit your work as instructed.


## The application must have the following features:
1. User authentication and profile update page
2. A page that shows 5 random quotes
    1. There should be a button to refresh the quotes
    2. There should be a button besides each quote to save it to your favorites
3. A page that shows your saved favorites. There should be a button to delete a quote from your favorites
4. Implement rate limiting for API requests to `https://dummyjson.com/quotes` preventing abuse. The API should be limited to 30 requests per minutes
5. Separate admin authentication for moderating saved user quotes and banning users
6. Frontend should be done with Vue.js and optionally Inertia.js
    1. Typescript should be used for any frontend functionality
    1. UI should be responsive
7. An API route should be available to fetch a specified number of quotes random quotes
8. An API route should be available to fetch your favorites quotes
9. An API route should be available to delete a quote from your favorites
10. All API route should be secured with an user token
11. Above features are to be tested with Feature tests

#### Extra Credit
* Use composition API and setup script for Vue components
* Use inertia to connect backend and frontend
* Provide a separate file with documentation

## Instructions
### DO NOT START A NEW LARAVEL APP, USE THIS BOILERPLATE INSTEAD !!

### Cloning the repository
1. Create a bare clone of the repository. (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)
    ```bash
    git clone --bare https://github.com/FmTod2/skill-assessment.git
    ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub.

3. Mirror-push your bare clone to your new repository.<br/>_Replace &lt;username&gt; with your actual Github username in the url below._<br/>_Replace &lt;repository&gt; with the name of your new repository._
    ```shell
    cd skill-assessment-quotes.git
    git push --mirror https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
    ```
4. Delete the bare clone created in step 1.
    ```shell
    cd ..
    rm -rf skill-assessment-quotes.git
    ```
   
5. You can now clone your repository, where you are going to be working, on your machine (in my case in the code folder).
    ```shell
    cd ~/code
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
    ```

## Getting Started

1. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

<details>
<summary> a. Docker (Recommended)</summary>

3. Install composer dependecies
    ```shell
    docker run --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
        -w /var/www/html \
        laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
        composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

4. Start the container (Sail):
    ```shell
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

5. Generate a new secret key:
    ```shell
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>b. Without Docker (Not recommended)</summary>

3. Install all required dependencies
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Generate a new secret key:
    ```shell
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

</details>

‼️ <i>Note: Docker is recommended as you have all the external dependecies needed are already present in the provided container. Without docker you may need to install some external dependencies like MySQL or some extra PHP extensions required by the project</i>

## Your first commit (IMPORTANT)
   
1. Edit the README.md file and add your name and email.
    ```diff
    - Name: `<your name>` <br/>
    - Email: `<your email>` <br/>
    + Name: Jhon Doe <br/>
    + Email: jhondoe@exmaple.com <br/>
    ```
   
2. Submit your first commit with just the changes to the README.md file. Must be done before starting the assignment.
    ```shell
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push
    ```
